# Mask Detection using ResNet-50

This repository contains a deep learning-based binary classification model that detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not.  
The model is implemented using PyTorch and trained on augmented data generated with MaskTheFace.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Binary classification of "mask" vs. "no mask"
- ResNet-50 backbone (both pretrained and scratch-tested)
- High accuracy with AUC reaching **0.99965**
- Real-time logging and performance visualization using WandB
- Data augmentation via **MaskTheFace** for better class balance
